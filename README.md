# Reapey

**Automated statistical job submission**



## Background

It is inevitable to help the teacher collect and count the homework while in school, but each time the statistics are tedious and it takes a lot of time. So I chose to help those "Learning Councillors" with **Python** to do this interesting (boring) job



## install

Developed using python3.7

You can use the pip command to install the corresponding library environment

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Usage

There are three things you need to do before running the `Reapey.py` program

1. You need to configure the running environment for your python program to run
2. You need to add the "`Name`" and "`Student number`" in the `list.txt` text. They must be separated by "`:`" (Note: English characters must be used!)
3. You need to put the files you want to count in the `files` folder and you need to name them ("`Student ID`" + "`Name`"). It is worth mentioning that if you only use the "`name`" to name the file, the program will automatically match the corresponding student number in the "`list.txt`" list and correctly name all files correctly

Once you have completed the above operations, you can run the program smoothly.

The console program will automatically perform statistics and print out the relevant data. After the statistics of the program are finished, a "`Statistical Record`" will be automatically generated. You can see the detailed information of this statistics in the generated "`log.txt`" file.



At present, the program is still being perfected, and "`Email Reminders`" and more automated functions will be added later. You can continue to pay attention to this project.

That's Reapey! You can add features and modify programs by yourself, so have fun!
